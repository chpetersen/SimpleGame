# SimpleGame

I wanted to learn how to make a simple game to Android. So I found this guide [How to Create a Simple Android Game](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4gxv-rfIQJuUpd_4F9hpskH3qz2oGWid) on youtube. Unfortunately, the quality of the video is so poor, that it's hard to see. So I created this repository which contains the same code, he's writing in the lessons.
